# Development-Status-Life-Expectancy-Analysis

# Introduction:

Life expectancy has been a topic of discussion around the world, whether it be how does a certain factor affect life expectancy to the life expectancy of developing countries vs developed countries. Many questions can be asked on how certain diseases affect life expectancies and if one disease is more prevalent in certain countries and/or if they're developing or developed.

# Questions:

- Does schooling have an affect on the life expectancy and disease transmissions within a country?
- Does the development status of a country affect the average life expectancy of a country?
- Which countries have the highest alcohol consumption and does this affect the overall health of the country?

# Findings:

- It appears that the mean HIV/AIDS cases are prevalent in developing countries compared to developed nations.
- Developing countries have a large range of life expectancies, however though there are lower amounts of developed nations, most outrank the life expectancies of underdeveloped nations.
- From the scatterplot, there seems to be a positive correlation between schooling and the life expectancies. From the data, it can be assumed that education powers development.
